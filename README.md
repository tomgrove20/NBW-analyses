# NBW-analyses

## Background
In summer 2018, beaked whales stranded across the coasts of the north-east Atlantic (both dead and alive)
As part of this, northern bottlenose whales spent at least two months in Skjalfandi Bay, north Iceland. During this time, we exhibited strange behaviours and a total of 7 strandings (as of 25/10/2018)

## Study aim
To document the occurrence, distribution and behaviour of northern bottlenose whales in Skjalfandi Bay
-Sightings maps
-PhotoID catalogues and matches
-Stranding reports
-Social network
